# This file specifies the individuals or teams that own code in this repository.

# are automatically requested for review.

# changes to core parts of the brAInwav MAS Platform receive appropriate review.

# unless more specific owners are defined below.
# This often represents the core maintainers or lead.
* @jamiescottcraik # Primary project owner and maintainer
