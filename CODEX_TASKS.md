   - Visualization: Charts for progress trends, time investment
   - Privacy: Aggregate data only, user consent for tracking

4. **Create offline support**
   - Current: Requires internet connection
   - Needed: Service worker for offline functionality
   - Scope: Cache roadmap data, progress tracking, resource bookmarks

### **Automation & DevOps**

1. **Enhance CI/CD pipeline**
   - Current: Basic deployment workflow
   - Needed: Multi-environment deployments, automated testing, performance monitoring
   - Tools: Preview deployments, lighthouse CI, security scanning
