This repository contains the source code for **[Project Name]**, a Multi-Agent System (MAS) built on the brAInwav production-grade template. Its mission is to **[briefly describe the project's primary goal, e.g., "autonomously organize and classify digital assets using the P.A.R.A. method."]**

This project adheres to a strict set of governance rules, architectural patterns, and automation principles to ensure quality, consistency, and auditability.

---

## Core Principles

This project is built on a foundation of three core principles:

* üèõÔ∏è **AI Governance:** All development is governed by a protected constitution (`/.ai/RULES_OF_AI.md`) that directs the behavior of both human and AI contributors.
* üîÅ **Reproducible Environments:** The entire development environment is containerized via Docker and Dev Containers, guaranteeing a "one-command" setup that works identically everywhere.
* ü§ñ **Automation & Auditability:** From pre-commit hooks that enforce quality to scripts that log AI contributions, the framework is designed to automate toil and maintain a transparent audit trail.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Multi-Agent Architecture:** A clean separation of concerns for building and orchestrating multiple AI agents.
* **Production-Ready CI/CD:** Pre-configured GitHub Actions for continuous integration, testing, and quality checks.
* **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** A mandated TDD workflow with a >=90% code coverage requirement.
* **AI Context Management:** A dedicated system for providing AI agents with dynamic, up-to-date project context.
* **Contract-First API:** A `shared/` directory with an OpenAPI schema ensures the frontend and backend are always in sync.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This project requires **Docker**, **VS Code**, and the **Dev Containers extension**. All other dependencies are managed within the container.

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/brawnwav/](https://github.com/brawnwav/)[your-repo-name].git
    cd [your-repo-name]
    ```

2.  **Open in Dev Container**
    * Open the folder in VS Code.
    * When prompted, click **"Reopen in Container"**.

3.  **Launch All Services**
    * Once the container is built, open a new terminal in VS Code.
    * Run the one-command setup script:
    ```bash
    sh scripts/dev/one_command_start.sh
    ```

For a more detailed walkthrough, see the **[One Command Setup Guide](docs/quickstart/ONE_COMMAND_SETUP.md)**.
