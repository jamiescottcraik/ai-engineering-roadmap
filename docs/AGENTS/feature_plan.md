## 🎨 Color Strategy & Learning Psychology Integration

- **Brand Foundation:**
  Core UI elements (nav, logo, primary actions) use brand colors for consistency and recognition.
- **Learning Psychology Layer:**
  - Green = mastered/complete, yellow = in progress, red/orange = needs review/urgent.
  - Progress bars, achievements, and feedback animate with motivating and energizing color transitions.
  - Use soft/neutral backgrounds for content to minimize cognitive load.
- **Accessibility:**
  All color usages meet WCAG contrast standards. Never rely on color alone—add icons and text labels for status.
- **User Empowerment:**
  Support theme customization (dark/light/high-contrast/focus mode). Allow user tagging/highlighting of topics with custom colors.
- **Documentation:**
  Maintain `/docs/COLOR_GUIDE.md` explaining palette, usage, and psychological rationale.

---

## 🧠 Learning Psychology Features

- **Cognitive Optimization:**
  Progressive disclosure, visual mapping, minimal context switching, dual coding (color + text).
- **Motivation:**
  Streaks, micro-rewards, milestone celebrations, challenge calibration, habit-building.
- **Memory:**
  Spaced repetition, active recall, interleaving, multi-modal (visual, text, interactive).
- **Focus:**
  Pomodoro integration, distraction blockers, energy tracking, optimal time suggestions.
- **Metacognition:**
  Reflection prompts, self-assessment, strategy suggestions, insight journaling.

---

## 📋 Testing & Quality Assurance Workflow

For each feature:

1. **Pre-implementation testing:** Document current behavior (if any)
2. **Post-implementation testing:** Verify new behavior, cross-browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
3. **Mobile testing:** At least one mobile device or emulator
4. **Accessibility:** ARIA, keyboard navigation, color contrast
5. **Error checking:** Console and runtime errors must be resolved

**Commit format:**
