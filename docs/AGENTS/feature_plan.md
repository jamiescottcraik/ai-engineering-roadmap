## üé® Color Strategy & Learning Psychology Integration

- **Brand Foundation:**  
  Core UI elements (nav, logo, primary actions) use brand colors for consistency and recognition.
- **Learning Psychology Layer:**  
  - Green = mastered/complete, yellow = in progress, red/orange = needs review/urgent.
  - Progress bars, achievements, and feedback animate with motivating and energizing color transitions.
  - Use soft/neutral backgrounds for content to minimize cognitive load.
- **Accessibility:**  
  All color usages meet WCAG contrast standards. Never rely on color alone‚Äîadd icons and text labels for status.
- **User Empowerment:**  
  Support theme customization (dark/light/high-contrast/focus mode). Allow user tagging/highlighting of topics with custom colors.
- **Documentation:**  
  Maintain `/docs/COLOR_GUIDE.md` explaining palette, usage, and psychological rationale.

---

## üß† Learning Psychology Features

- **Cognitive Optimization:**  
  Progressive disclosure, visual mapping, minimal context switching, dual coding (color + text).
- **Motivation:**  
  Streaks, micro-rewards, milestone celebrations, challenge calibration, habit-building.
- **Memory:**  
  Spaced repetition, active recall, interleaving, multi-modal (visual, text, interactive).
- **Focus:**  
  Pomodoro integration, distraction blockers, energy tracking, optimal time suggestions.
- **Metacognition:**  
  Reflection prompts, self-assessment, strategy suggestions, insight journaling.

## üìã Testing & Quality Assurance Workflow

For each feature:

1. **Pre-implementation testing:** Document current behavior (if any)
2. **Post-implementation testing:** Verify new behavior, cross-browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
3. **Mobile testing:** At least one mobile device or emulator
4. **Accessibility:** ARIA, keyboard navigation, color contrast
5. **Error checking:** Console and runtime errors must be resolved

**Commit format:**

```bash
feat(area): brief description of change

Detailed description explaining the change, including:
- What was changed
- Why it was changed
- Any testing performed

Closes #issue-number (if applicable)
```

---

## üîÑ Review & Progress Tracking

- All phases and tasks tracked in project issues/cards (Kanban)
- Daily commits with status updates
- After each phase: feature review, cross-device testing, technical debt log, summary commit
- Use `/docs/feature_plan.md` as the living source of truth

---

## üìù Additional Recommendations

- **Self-competition analytics:** Track streaks, ‚Äúpersonal bests,‚Äù and provide celebratory feedback.
- **Privacy-first:** All personal data is stored locally by default, with optional export/sync.
- **Documentation:** Maintain `/docs/COLOR_GUIDE.md` and `/docs/LEARNING_PSYCHOLOGY.md` for rationale and onboarding.
- **Continuous improvement:** Regularly review features against current learning science and user feedback.
