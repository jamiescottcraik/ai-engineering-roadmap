# AI Partnership

This document translates AI governance for human collaborators.  
See `.ai/RULES_FOR_AI.md` for agent rules.

---

## ü§ù Purpose

To establish clear, transparent principles for productive human‚ÄìAI collaboration within the brAInwav platform.  
This ensures both human contributors and AI agents operate with mutual understanding, shared standards, and trust.

---

## üß≠ Core Principles

- **Alignment:** Human contributions should align with the constitutional rules in `.ai/RULES_OF_AI.md`.
- **Transparency:** All AI-generated code, suggestions, or documentation must be clearly indicated and attributable.
- **Review:** Human review of AI contributions is mandatory before merge into protected branches.
- **Escalation:** Any ambiguity, conflict, or suspected AI error must be escalated following the process in `.ai/RULES_OF_AI.md` ¬ß8.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Feedback on AI agent behavior, output, or workflows should be logged as GitHub issues and considered in ADRs.

---

## üë©‚Äçüíª Human Collaborator Responsibilities

- **Understand the Rules:** Familiarize yourself with `.ai/RULES_OF_AI.md` and this document.
- **Review AI Outputs:** Critically assess code, documentation, and suggestions generated by AI agents.
- **Audit Agent Signatures:** Ensure all AI-generated commits and PRs include the required signature block (see AGENT.md).
- **Quality Gates:** Never approve or merge code that fails quality, security, or accessibility checks‚Äîeven if generated by an AI.
- **Document Decisions:** Use ADRs for any significant human intervention, override, or exception to AI agent recommendations.

---

## üõë Conflict & Escalation

If a human collaborator believes any AI-generated work violates rules, is unsafe, or introduces ambiguity:

1. **Pause the workflow** (stop the PR or merge).
2. **Open a GitHub issue** tagged `escalation` and reference the relevant rule(s).
3. **Notify the repository owner** (see CODEOWNERS or `.ai/RULES_OF_AI.md`).
4. **Document the resolution** in an ADR if required.
