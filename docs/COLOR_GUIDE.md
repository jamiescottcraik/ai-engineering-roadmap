## 2. Color in Learning Psychology

### a. Motivation & Progress

- **Green (`#16C784` or brand variant):**  
  - Used for completed items, mastery, and streaks.  
  - Appears in progress bars, checkmarks, and positive feedback.
- **Gold/Yellow (`#FFD600`):**  
  - Used for in-progress, current focus, or milestone achievements.
  - Progress bars transition from yellow to green as goals are reached.
- **Red/Orange (`#FF3E3E` or orange variant):**  
  - Signals errors, overdue reviews, or items needing urgent attention.

### b. Focus & Cognitive Load

- **Neutral backgrounds (`#F4F5F7`, white, or dark navy):**  
  - Minimize distraction and visual fatigue.
- **Accent colors (brand pink, blue):**  
  - Draw attention to primary actions or new features, but used sparingly.

### c. Dual Coding & Memory

- **Color-coded nodes/paths:**  
  - Each learning node can use color to denote category or status (e.g., theory = blue, practice = green, project = gold).
  - Consistent use of color improves recall and navigation.

---

## 3. Accessibility

- Ensure WCAG AA contrast for all text/background and icon combinations.
- Never use color alone to convey meaning—pair with icons, text, or patterns.
- All status and progress indicators must have non-color cues (e.g., icons, labels).

---

## 4. User Personalization

- **Theme switching:**  
  Support light, dark, and high-contrast modes.
- **Custom node tagging:**  
  Allow users to tag or highlight topics with their own color for emotion or motivation.
- **Focus mode:**  
  Option to reduce color saturation for deep work sessions.
