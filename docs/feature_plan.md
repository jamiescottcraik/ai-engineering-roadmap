# Copilot Contributor Plan: Interactive Roadmap Enhancement

This plan guides Copilot in helping you improve your roadmap component and project UX. Follow each phase step-by-step, using granular PRs for each milestone.

---

## 1. Baseline Audit & Context Setup

- [ ] Review existing `roadmap` component code and dependencies.
- [ ] List all current features (interactivity, links, mobile support, etc.).
- [ ] Document any user feedback or pain points.
- [ ] Identify technical debt or hard-to-maintain code.

---

## 2. Define & Prioritize Enhancements

- [ ] Summarize and prioritize UX enhancements (see below).
- [ ] For each item, describe the intended user benefit.
- [ ] Tag each with "High", "Medium", or "Low" priority.

### Suggested Enhancements (add/adjust as needed)
- [ ] Topline intro and context for roadmap page.
- [ ] Visual progress/status badges for each roadmap item.
- [ ] **All nodes must display direct links to required learning resources in the UI.**
- [ ] Node design and layout should closely resemble [roadmap.sh/full-stack](https://roadmap.sh/full-stack):
    - Vertical, step-wise progression with clear section headers for each phase/track.
    - Nodes are rectangular, with text and icons, and offer clear visual grouping for prerequisites and optional tracks.
    - Hover/click opens a panel or popover with:
        - Description of the item
        - All relevant learning resources as clickable links with type icons
        - Completion criteria
        - Optionally, rationale/“why this matters”
    - Visually indicate optional vs. required tracks.
    - Clearly show completed/in-progress/todo status with color or icon.
    - Smooth, responsive zoom/pan.
- [ ] Mobile responsive design improvements (pinch/zoom, collapsible).
- [ ] Community feedback mechanism.
- [ ] “Why this matters” rationale per item (optional).

---

## 3. Learning Resource Access (Required — Must Implement)

**Goal:** Every roadmap milestone/node in the interactive roadmap MUST visibly surface direct links to required learning resources (courses, articles, practice platforms) so users can access them without leaving the roadmap interface.

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Each roadmap node must have a `resources` array (title, url, type).
- [ ] Clicking or hovering on a node opens a panel or modal that:
    - Lists all required resources as clickable links, with type icons and optional short descriptions.
    - Optionally, shows completion criteria and rationale.
- [ ] Show a visible indicator (icon or badge) if a node has required resources.
- [ ] Update roadmap data structure and UI components for this display, matching the roadmap.sh style as closely as possible.
- [ ] Add automated tests verifying all required resources are surfaced in the UI.
- [ ] Document this behavior in the README and user docs.

---

## 4. Node & Layout Redesign

- [ ] Refactor roadmap layout to vertical, step-wise sections (matching roadmap.sh).
- [ ] Implement rectangular node design with clear text, icons, and groupings.
- [ ] Add visual connectors for prerequisites and dependencies as lines or arrows.
- [ ] Color-code nodes for status (todo/in-progress/done) and optionality.
- [ ] Responsive navigation and smooth pan/zoom.

---

## 5. Implementation Roadmap (Iterative PRs)

For each prioritized enhancement:
- [ ] Draft a design/UX spec (short, focused).
- [ ] List affected files/components.
- [ ] Create a branch per enhancement.
- [ ] Write, test, and review code.
- [ ] Update docs and usage examples.
- [ ] Link PRs to relevant issues/enhancement requests.

---

## 6. Testing & Feedback

- [ ] Write or update unit/component tests.
- [ ] Test on multiple screen sizes/devices.
- [ ] Collect feedback from users or reviewers.
- [ ] Iterate on feedback, update roadmap with learnings.

---

## 7. Documentation & Showcasing

- [ ] Update project README with new features and screenshots.
- [ ] Add a “How to contribute” section for roadmap suggestions.
- [ ] Optionally: Write a devlog or blog post about the process.

---

## 8. Ongoing Maintenance

- [ ] Monitor roadmap usage and gather ongoing feedback.
- [ ] Triage and address bugs or usability issues.
- [ ] Repeat process for future enhancements.

---

**Tip:** Track progress with GitHub issues and project boards. Keep PRs focused and small for easier reviews.
