# AGENT Feature Plan: AI Engineering Roadmap Modernization

## Objective

To transform the `ai-engineering-roadmap` repository into a modern, interactive personal learning platform‚Äîinspired by roadmap.sh but optimized for individual use. The implementation will be done via a new branch with regular commits, automated testing, and error fixing.

## üìã Testing & Quality Assurance Workflow

For each feature implementation:

1. **Pre-implementation testing**: Document current behavior
2. **Post-implementation testing**: Verify new behavior works as expected
3. **Cross-browser testing**: Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari
4. **Mobile testing**: Test on at least one mobile device
5. **Error checking**: Verify console is free of errors

**Required commit format**:
```
feat(area): brief description of change

Detailed description explaining the change, including:
- What was changed
- Why it was changed
- Any testing performed

Closes #issue-number (if applicable)
```

---

## üìä Progress Tracking Methodology

- **Phase tracking**: Mark each phase as "Not Started", "In Progress", or "Completed"
- **Individual task tracking**: Check off tasks as they are completed
- **Testing documentation**: Note any issues found and how they were resolved
- **Regular status updates**: Commit at least once daily with progress updates

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & References

- **GitHub Copilot**: Use for code generation and debugging assistance
- **OpenAI Codex**: Leverage for complex algorithm design and optimization
- **roadmap.sh reference**: https://roadmap.sh/ai-engineer
- **developer-roadmap repo**: https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap
- **Learning psychology research**: Incorporate spaced repetition and active recall principles

---

## üîÑ Review Process

At the end of each phase:
1. Review all completed tasks against objectives
2. Test all new functionality
3. Document any technical debt or future improvements
4. Create a summary commit with phase completion notes

## Implementation Guidance

When working on this branch, I recommend:

1. **Use incremental commits**: Make smaller, more frequent commits instead of large changes
2. **Test as you go**: Test each feature immediately after implementation
3. **Focus on quick wins first**: Start with the CSS and interactive improvements for immediate visual impact
4. **Document everything**: Add comments and documentation as you implement features

The plan focuses first on the foundational improvements that will make your roadmap more interactive and user-friendly, then builds up to more complex features like the progress dashboard and filtering system.
