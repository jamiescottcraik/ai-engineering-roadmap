## 🧠 Recall.ai Knowledge Base Structure

Your platform automatically organizes learning into these categories:

```
📁 01_Python_Fundamentals/
   └── Core Python concepts, syntax, patterns
📁 02_Machine_Learning/
   └── ML algorithms, techniques, implementations
📁 03_Deep_Learning/
   └── Neural networks, architectures, frameworks
📁 04_LLMs_GenAI/
   └── Large language models, generative AI
📁 05_MLOps_Production/
   └── Deployment, monitoring, scaling ML systems
📁 06_Open_Source_AI/
   └── OSS contributions, community projects
📁 07_AI_Security/
   └── AI safety, red teaming, ethics
📁 08_Projects/
   └── Portfolio projects, implementations
📁 09_Career_Portfolio/
   └── Personal brand, blog posts, presentations
📁 10_Daily_Learning_Logs/
   └── Reflections, insights, progress tracking
```

### **Enhanced Learning Cycle**
**Learn → Practice → RECALL → Project → Publish**
