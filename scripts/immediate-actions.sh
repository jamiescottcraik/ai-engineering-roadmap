# Day 1 of My 48-Week AI Engineering Journey

**Date:** $(date '+%Y-%m-%d')
**Week:** 1 of 48
**Phase:** Python Mastery & Foundations

## Why I'm Starting This Journey

Today marks the beginning of my structured path to becoming an AI Engineer. I'm following Jamie Scott Craik's comprehensive 48-week roadmap that takes me from Python fundamentals to AI leadership.

## My 48-Week Roadmap Overview

- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-8):** Python Mastery & Foundations
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 9-20):** Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 21-32):** LLMs, GenAI & Advanced NLP
- **Phase 4 (Weeks 33-40):** AI Safety & Red Teaming
- **Phase 5 (Weeks 41-44):** Production MLOps & Scaling
- **Phase 6 (Weeks 45-48):** Quantum ML & Causal AI

## Week 1 Goals and Projects

This week I'm focusing on:

1. **GitHub Stats CLI Tool** - My first project to practice Python
2. **Coursera Python Track** - Structured learning foundation
3. **Daily Recall.ai** - Knowledge capture and review
4. **Community Engagement** - Join Discord communities, LinkedIn networking

## Learning Stack and Tools

- **Recall.ai** for knowledge capture and spaced repetition
- **Ollama** for local AI assistance and privacy
- **GitHub** for portfolio and project tracking
- **Coursera/DeepLearning.AI** for structured courses
- **Discord communities** for peer learning

## How to Follow Along

I'm building in public! You can follow my journey:

- **GitHub:** [ai-engineering-portfolio repo]
- **LinkedIn:** [Daily updates and insights]
- **Blog:** [Weekly progress posts]

## Success Formula

My enhanced learning cycle: **Learn → Practice → RECALL → Project → Publish**

Every expert was once a beginner who refused to give up. Let's build the future of AI together! 🚀
